spl
index="log-10368-prod-c" "C:\\BuildOperationService" ("--START---GetBulkCorpActionPendingJournals" OR "--END---GetBulkPendingCorpJornals---")
| transaction startswith="--START---GetBulkCorpActionPendingJournals" endswith="--END---GetBulkPendingCorpJornals---" maxspan=10m
| eval duration = duration
| table _time, duration
| stats avg(duration) as avg_duration, max(duration) as max_duration, min(duration) as min_duration, count as total_executions
Alternative approach using streamstats (more precise):

spl
index="log-10368-prod-c" "C:\\BuildOperationService" ("--START---GetBulkCorpActionPendingJournals" OR "--END---GetBulkPendingCorpJornals---")
| eval type = case(
    like(message, "%--START---GetBulkCorpActionPendingJournals%"), "start",
    like(message, "%--END---GetBulkPendingCorpJornals---%"), "end"
)
| sort _time
| streamstats current=f last(_time) as prev_time by type
| where type="end" AND prev_time IS NOT NULL
| eval execution_time = _time - prev_time
| stats avg(execution_time) as avg_execution_time, max(execution_time) as max_execution_time, min(execution_time) as min_execution_time, count as total_operations
To see individual execution times:

spl
index="log-10368-prod-c" "C:\\BuildOperationService" ("--START---GetBulkCorpActionPendingJournals" OR "--END---GetBulkPendingCorpJornals---")
| transaction startswith="--START---GetBulkCorpActionPendingJournals" endswith="--END---GetBulkPendingCorpJornals---" maxspan=10m
| eval execution_time = duration
| table _time, execution_time
| eval execution_time_seconds = round(execution_time, 3)
| sort _time
Key points about the query:

transaction command: Groups START and END events together as a single transaction

maxspan=10m: Assumes no execution takes longer than 10 minutes (adjust if needed)

duration: Automatically calculates the time difference between start and end events

stats: Provides summary statistics (average, max, min execution times)

The query will give you:

Average execution time

Maximum execution time

Minimum execution time

Total number of executions

You can adjust the maxspan parameter if your executions typically take longer than 10 minutes.
