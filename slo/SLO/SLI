1. SLO – Service Level Objective

This is a target or goal for how reliable or available a service should be.

🧠 Think of SLO as the “performance promise” you aim to achieve.

✅ Example:

“Our API should have 99.9% uptime per month.”
“User requests should complete in under 300 ms 95% of the time.”

So —

Uptime SLO: 99.9%

Latency SLO: 95% under 300ms

🔹 2. SLI – Service Level Indicator

This is the actual measurement of system performance — what you track to see if you meet your SLO.

🧠 Think of SLI as “the real score” compared to the target.

✅ Example:

“This month, uptime was 99.7%.”
“90% of requests completed under 300 ms.”

SLI tells you how you’re doing, and SLO tells you what you aim for.

🔹 3. Error Budget

The “allowed failure margin” based on your SLO.
It defines how much unreliability is acceptable before you must take action.

🧠 Think of the error budget as a “forgiveness limit”.

✅ Example:
If your SLO = 99.9% uptime,
then your error budget = 0.1% downtime per month.

That’s about 43 minutes of downtime in a 30-day month.

So if your system goes down for:

10 minutes → still safe

40 minutes → almost used up your error budget

1 hour → SLO violated 🚨

🔹 4. Error Budget Dashboard

A visual dashboard (often in tools like Grafana, Datadog, or Google Cloud Monitoring) that shows:

Current SLO compliance (e.g., 99.85%)

Error budget remaining (e.g., 75% budget left)

Alerts when the budget is exhausted

Trends over time (e.g., last 30 days)

✅ Purpose:
It helps SRE teams balance:

Reliability (uptime)

Innovation speed (deployments)

If your error budget is healthy, you can deploy more.
If it’s used up, you should pause releases and fix stability.
