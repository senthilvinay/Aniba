Thanks for raising this. A common KB should be sufficient to cover both treadmill CPU utilization and pod container memory utilization, as the handling guidelines largely overlap.

Regarding the restart approach:

During business hours, it is not recommended to restart/delete pods directly, considering the potential impact on running services.

For highly critical cases, we need to have confirmation from both Dev and ASG before taking any such action.

Outside business hours, restart can be considered, but still keeping Dev/ASG alignment is best practice.


This way we ensure consistency while also reducing risk in production
