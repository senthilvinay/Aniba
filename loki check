Hi WM Observe Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

As part of our ongoing efforts to migrate all Splunk alerts to Loki, I wanted to check with your team regarding a specific feature. Could you please verify if a lookup-like concept, similar to what we use in Splunk, is available in Loki?

Understanding the availability of this feature will help us better plan and adapt our migration process.

Looking forward to your insights on this. Please let me know if you need any additional details from my side.

Thanks in advance for your support!

Best regards,
Senthil Vinayagam
