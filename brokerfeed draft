Subject: Incident Summary – Broker Feed Data Load Failure (PROD)

Dear Team,

We encountered a Data Load Failure in PROD: Broker Feed Data Load. Please find the details below:

Issue:

The Broker Feed job failed on Tuesday because it was configured to read the previous day’s file (Monday).

Since the scheduler and the MF job PBKRDBKP only run from Tuesday to Saturday, no file is generated on Sunday.

As a result, the previous day file for Tuesday is not available, leading to failure.


Impact:

There is no functional impact to downstream systems, as Friday’s data continues to be used until Tuesday.

oot Cause:

Job dependency was on the previous day’s file.

Missing file on Sunday caused Tuesday’s load to fail.


Resolution Plan / Fix:

1. Reschedule the Broker Feed job to 6:30 AM to ensure PBKRDBKP has completed and the file is available.


2. Reconfigure the job to pick the same day’s file instead of the previous day’s file.


3. This change is being implemented this week, after which Tuesday failures will be resolved.



Next Steps:

Post-change validation will be performed to confirm successful runs on Tuesday.

Optional review: consider enabling a Sunday run in the long term to eliminate such gaps.
