Thanks for the quick discussion regarding the Crontab feature available in MKS and the related query below.

Could you please share your insights on the following point?

We are currently using the Crontab scheduler functionality to restart the MKS instance during the weekend in our QA environment.

Before promoting to PROD, we have one key question regarding the Crontab configuration:

As part of the Crontab schedule configuration, there's a parameter under the config map that previously used the value service. Based on the latest documentation, we’ve updated this parameter to cronservice, which is now a mandatory value.

> This change is reflected in the configmap.yaml as part of the application config setup.



Our concern is whether this change will have any impact on the MKS application if the application_type is now defined as cronservice instead of service.

Could you please confirm if this change is acceptable for the MKS app to function correctly in PROD?
