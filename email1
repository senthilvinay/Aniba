Dear Team,

As part of the planned weekend DB migration activity for the PNSRT and D'ATA applications, we request your support in placing the following items on hold:

Autosys Jobs:
Please place all relevant jobs associated with PNSRT and D'ATA in ON-ICE status before the activity begins.

Apica Monitoring Checks:
Kindly suspend Apica synthetic monitoring for the above applications during the migration window to avoid false alerts.

ðŸ”§ Activity Window:
Start: [Insert Start Date & Time]
End: [Insert End Date & Time]

We will notify you once the migration is complete and it is safe to resume regular scheduling and monitoring.

Please let us know once the changes are in place, or if any further information is required.

Thank you for your support and coordination.

Best regards,
Senthil Vinayagam
